**Citing Hoki**
################

A peer-reviewed journal article about `hoki` will appear in due time but for now you can use the following bibtex entry:

.. code-block:: none

   @Misc{hoki_citation,
     author =   {Heloise Stevance},
     title =    {Hoki},
     howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/HeloiseS/hoki}},
     doi = {10.5281/zenodo.3445659},
     year = {2019}
     } 


**Please if you use `hoki` for your science, do include us in your publications!** As you can imagine developing a tool and maintaining it for the community is very time consuming, and unfortunately citations remain the most important metric.
