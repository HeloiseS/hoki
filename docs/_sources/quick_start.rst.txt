Install Hoki
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the most recent stable release of hoki you can use:

.. code-block:: none

   sudo pip3 install --user hoki 
   
If you are feeling adventurous and want the most recent (in development) version of hoki, you can clone our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/HeloiseS/hoki>`__

Download the tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
They can be found in the side-bar to read, but you can dowload the `jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/HeloiseS/hoki_tutorials>`__ so you can play with them later. 

Download the BPASS models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BPASS models can be downloaded from the BPASS:

``hoki`` is dedicated to being an interface with the BPASS models, but given the substancial size of the entire set of models, they are not downloaded upon installation of ``hoki``, and you should download the models you want to work on.


***************
Loading in Data
***************
.. tip::
  More details on the outputs mentioned below can be found in the `BPASS manual <https://bpass.auckland.ac.nz/8/files/bpassv2_1_manual_accessible_version.pdf>`__. 


Stellar Population Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A stellar output file can be loaded in using the ``model_output()`` function in the ``load`` module. 

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   
   from hoki import load
   
   output = load.model_output('path_to_output')
   

The function will figure out based on the file name what data is being loaded in and will return the appropriate data format: ``pandas.DataFrames`` in most cases, apart from HR diagrams, which have their own ``HRDiagrams`` class -- because they're quite a complex data structure. 

Here we summarise the shape of the outputs (51 time bins) for a given metalicity and IMF. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Output
     - File Name Root
     - Shape
   * - Massive star type numbers
     - numbers
     - 51 x 21
   * - Supernova Rates
     - supernova
     - 51 x 18
   * - Energy and elemental yields
     - yields
     - 51 x 9
   * - Stellar mass remaining at the end
     - starmass
     - 51 x 3
   * - HR diagrams
     - hrs
     - 51 x 100 x 100 x 3 x 3


Spectral Synthesis Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The spectral synthesis output files can be also loaded in using the ``model_output()`` function in the ``load`` module. 
All outputs are returned as ``pandas.DataFrames`` with sensible column names. 

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   
   from hoki import load
   
   output = load.model_output('path_to_output')
   

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Output
     - File Name Root
     - Shape
   * - Spectra (SEDs)
     - spectra
     - 52x10E5
   * - Ionizing flux predictions
     - ionizing
     - 51x5
   * - Colours (broad-band)
     - colours
     - 51x26

The full suite of stellar models is also available from the BPASS website (careful, the file is big ~50GB), and they are required to make colour magnitude diagram (CMD) such as in Figure 24 of `BPASSv2.1 <https://bpass.auckland.ac.nz/8.html>`__. Creating these CMD and exploring these files is very tricky - in a future release ``hoki`` will offer features to make this straight forward. 

Stellar Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to the population and spectral synthesis outputs, the stellar models are also available as a BPASS data product. They can be downloaded from the `google drive <ttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BS2w9hpdaJeul6-YtZum--F4gxWIPYXl>`__: the name of the folder containing the most recent models is **bpass-v2.2-newmodels**.

.. warning:: These folder is ~50 GB. Make sure you have a good internet connection and sufficient space. 

The stellar models are required to make Colour-Magnitude Diagrams (see RECIPES) and other deeper searches within the models that are not summarised in the population or spectral synthesis outputs. 

.. note:: 
   This is where the files names ``model_input`` become necesary. They are not human readable but are used within ``hoki`` to apply the correct algorithm to the stellar models in order to collate them correctly. (So don't panic if you open them and wonder what is going on). 


***************
Citing Hoki
***************
A peer-reviewed journal article about ``hoki`` will appear in due time but for now you can use the following bibtex entry:

.. code-block:: none

   @Misc{hoki_citation,
     author =   {Heloise Stevance},
     title =    {Hoki},
     howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/HeloiseS/hoki}},
     doi = {10.5281/zenodo.3445659},
     year = {2019}
     } 


**Please if you use `hoki` for your science, do include us in your publications!** As you can imagine developing a tool and maintaining it for the community is very time consuming, and unfortunatly citations remain the most important metric.
